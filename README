Web Tank Arena is a freetime project that wants to give a simlar game to Tank Arena. Code is GNU/GPL.

Thanks to Jorrit Rowe and Dennis Medema i could use the original graphics of the game under the Creative Common Non-Commercial Attribution Licence.

You're welcome to push you own commits !

I wrote an article about the way i'll do it on my blog and i'll publish a roadmap for the game (in french). English versions will come soon.
